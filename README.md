# marbs

IF YOU DON'T WANT THE DOT FILES THEN COMMENT THE FIRST FEW COPY LINES OUT OF INSTALL.SH!!!!!!

TODO - gsettings stuff for gnome. Dark mode, etc

How to use the badness:

git clone https://github.com/moblevortex/marbs.git

cd marbs

./install.sh

log out, log back in if the script does not do it automatically

If the dot files failed to copy, or you've decided you want them after running install.sh then:

cd marbs

./copy.sh

Configure to your liking & enjoy.
