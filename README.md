# marbs

TODO - gsettings stuff for gnome. Dark mode, etc

How to use the badness:

git clone https://github.com/moblevortex/marbs.git

cd marbs

./install.sh

log out, log back in

If you want the extra dot files then: ## Use at your own risk - I did not update those files

cd marbs

./copy.sh

Configure to your liking & enjoy.
